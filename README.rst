Features
~~~~~~~~

* Rapidly select related objects via a smooth autocomplete interface
* A drop-in alternative to ``FieldPanel``
* Create new objects from the autocomplete input if your search turns up blank
* React component can be used outside of the Wagtail admin for public-facing forms
* Default theme shares the color scheme and styles of the Wagtail admin
* Easy to re-theme with `BEM <http://getbem.com/>`_ methodology

Whoâ€™s using it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The `U.S. Press Freedom Tracker <https://pressfreedomtracker.us/>`_ makes extensive use of this edit handler with its public-facing filters and content editor to rapidly select and create new related metadata objects.

Merge into wagtail/wagtail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eventually we would like this to be merged into `wagtail/wagtail <https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/>`_.
This will require some work on the Wagtail API.

* Support endpoints for non-``Page`` models
* Support standard `Django field lookups <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/models/querysets/#id4>`_ such as ``id__in``
* Create objects from the API
* Permission system for non-administrator access to the API
